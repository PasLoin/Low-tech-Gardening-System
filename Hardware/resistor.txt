# For the first commit i use only one resistor linked to the ground. 
# For this project resistor is recyled from trash, so the value can be different and so the code too.

# Todo : 
#   1/ test adding resistor to the pin set to HIGH and mesure range and change the code to print avereage value
#   2/ deppending on resistor (close to random) used ; make the code using resistor stored in parameters.
